# UI Revamp Implementation Summary

## Overview
Complete overhaul of the renderer UI to replace the depotcache-scanning workflow with a new single-app flow that accepts an App ID, displays parsed depot/key data, previews Lua output, and provides controls for Lua export and manifest copying.

## Changes Made

### 1. index.html - Complete Redesign
**Changed:**
- Default theme from `light` to `dark` (`data-theme="dark"`)
- Title from "Depot Manifest Manager" to "Steam App Manifest Manager"
- Removed old workflow buttons: "Scan Steam", "Scan Folder", "Select Files"
- Removed old configuration options: Default APPID inference, Dump Mode, Filename Pattern, Output Structure

**Added:**
- Theme toggle switch in navbar (moon/sun icons)
- Toast notification container for status messages
- New input field: App ID (numeric Steam application ID)
- New checkbox: Include DLC Depots (checked by default)
- New buttons:
  - **Load App Manifest** - Loads app data via IPC
  - **Generate Lua File** - Saves Lua script to file
  - **Copy Manifests** - Copies manifest files to output directory
- App name display above depot table
- Updated table columns:
  - Depot ID (read-only display)
  - Manifest ID (read-only display)
  - Decryption Key (displays "Missing" if unavailable)
  - Type (Main/DLC badge)
- Enhanced statistics panel:
  - Depots with Keys
  - Missing Keys (warning color)
  - Total Depots

### 2. renderer.js - Complete Rewrite
**New State Structure:**
```javascript
{
  appId: '',
  appName: '',
  outputFolder: '',
  includeDlc: true,
  depots: [],
  theme: 'dark'
}
```

**Removed Functions:**
- `validateRow()` - No longer needed (data comes validated from backend)
- `inferAppIdFromFilename()` - Removed legacy inference logic
- `applyInference()` - Removed legacy inference logic
- `handleScanFolder()` - Removed old scan workflow
- `handleScanDepotcache()` - Removed old scan workflow
- `handleSelectFiles()` - Removed old file selection workflow
- `handleConfigChange()` - Removed old config handling
- `handleStructureChange()` - Removed old structure options

**New Functions:**
- `showToast(message, type)` - Displays toast notifications (success/error/warning/info)
- `handleLoadApp()` - Calls `steam:loadAppData` IPC to load app manifest data
- `handleGenerateLua()` - Generates and saves Lua file via `save:output` IPC
- `handleCopyManifests()` - Copies manifest files via `steam:copyManifests` IPC
- `handleThemeToggle()` - Switches between dark/light themes
- `handleIncludeDlcChange()` - Updates preview when DLC checkbox changes

**Updated Functions:**
- `generateLuaOutput()` - Completely rewritten to generate new format:
  ```lua
  addappid(APP_ID)
  setManifestid(APP_ID, "manifest")
  addappid(depot_id, 0, "key")
  setManifestid(depot_id, "manifest")
  ```
- `renderTable()` - Now displays read-only depot data with visual indicators for missing keys
- `updatePreview()` - Updates stats and button states based on depot data

**Key Behaviors:**
- Lua generation skips depots without decryption keys
- DLC depots are included/excluded based on checkbox state
- Buttons are disabled until appropriate data is loaded
- Toast notifications provide user feedback for all actions
- Enter key on App ID input triggers loading

### 3. preload.js - No Changes Required
The preload script already exposes the necessary IPC handlers:
- `loadAppData(options)` - For loading app manifest data
- `copyManifests(options)` - For copying manifest files
- `saveOutput(data)` - For saving Lua files
- `selectFolder()` - For selecting output directory

### 4. Tests - New Renderer Tests
**File:** `src/tests/renderer.test.js`

**Test Coverage:**
1. `testLuaGenerationWithMainDepot()` - Validates basic Lua generation with main depot
2. `testLuaGenerationWithDLC()` - Validates DLC depots are included when enabled
3. `testLuaGenerationExcludeDLC()` - Validates DLC depots are excluded when disabled
4. `testLuaGenerationSkipMissingKeys()` - Validates depots without keys are skipped
5. `testLuaGenerationNoDepotsWithKeys()` - Validates fallback message when no keys available
6. `testLuaGenerationFormat()` - Validates exact Lua function call format

All tests pass successfully.

### 5. Build Configuration
**Updated:** `package.json` - Added renderer test to test suite
```json
"test": "... && node src/tests/renderer.test.js"
```

## Lua Output Format

The new Lua generation follows this exact format:

```lua
-- Generated Lua script for App ID: 123456
-- App Name: Example Game
-- Generated: 2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
-- Include DLC: Yes

addappid(123456)
setManifestid(123456, "main_manifest_id")

addappid(depot_id_1, 0, "decryption_key_1")
setManifestid(depot_id_1, "manifest_id_1")
addappid(depot_id_2, 0, "decryption_key_2")
setManifestid(depot_id_2, "manifest_id_2")
```

### Format Rules:
1. Main app ID is added first with `addappid(APP_ID)`
2. Main depot manifest is set with `setManifestid(APP_ID, "manifest")`
3. For each depot with a decryption key:
   - `addappid(depot_id, 0, "key")` - Second parameter is always 0
   - `setManifestid(depot_id, "manifest")` - Immediately follows
4. Depots without decryption keys are completely omitted
5. DLC depots are only included if "Include DLC" checkbox is checked

## User Experience Improvements

### Visual Feedback
- Toast notifications for all user actions
- Loading states and disabled buttons
- Color-coded depot rows (warning highlight for missing keys)
- Badge indicators for depot types (Primary for Main, Secondary for DLC)
- Statistics panel showing counts at a glance

### Theme Support
- Dark mode by default (better for extended use)
- Light mode available via toggle switch
- Persistent theme selection during session

### Workflow Simplification
- Single input required: App ID
- All depot data loaded automatically from Steam
- Clear visual indication of which depots have/lack keys
- Preview updates in real-time as settings change
- One-click operations for all export actions

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

✅ Default UI opens in dark mode with the new layout and controls  
✅ Entering an App ID and hitting Load populates the table with correct depot rows  
✅ Lua preview matches the required format exactly  
✅ Lua generation omits depots lacking keys  
✅ DLC rows included only when checkbox is ticked  
✅ Uses exact function names: `addappid()` and `setManifestid()`  
✅ Generate Lua File saves `{appId}.lua` via IPC  
✅ Copy Manifests triggers IPC and reports results  
✅ Old buttons/workflows removed (Scan Depotcache, etc.)  
✅ UI tests pass (6 new renderer tests added)  

## Technical Highlights

### Code Quality
- Clean separation of concerns (UI state vs. business logic)
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Cross-platform compatible (uses existing IPC layer)
- Type-safe interactions (validates App ID format)
- No commented code (clean implementation)

### Testing
- Comprehensive test coverage for Lua generation logic
- All edge cases covered (no keys, DLC filtering, format validation)
- Tests use mock data to avoid Steam dependency
- Added to existing test suite seamlessly

### Performance
- Efficient rendering (only updates when needed)
- No unnecessary re-renders or state updates
- Minimal DOM manipulation
- Small bundle size (no additional dependencies)

## Migration Notes

### Removed Features
The following features from the old UI were intentionally removed as they're no longer part of the new workflow:
- Manual file scanning/selection
- APPID inference from filenames
- Custom filename patterns
- Output structure options (flat/nested/grouped)
- Dump mode selection
- Manual editing of depot fields

These were replaced with automatic data loading from Steam's app manifests, which provides more reliable and complete information.

### Breaking Changes
None - this is a UI-only update. The backend IPC handlers (`steam:loadAppData`, `steam:copyManifests`) remain unchanged and are fully compatible.

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Steam path override option in UI
- Recent App IDs history/favorites
- Batch processing of multiple App IDs
- Export to other formats (JSON, CSV)
- Advanced filtering options for depots
- Manifest file validation before copy
- Integration with SteamCMD for missing keys
